## 🌍 Context

The Spanish government is actively exploring opportunities to expand its **renewable energy infrastructure**. To ensure successful implementation, **accurate forecasting of energy shortfalls** is crucial.

This project addresses that need by performing an in-depth analysis of **renewable vs. fossil fuel energy generation in Spain**. By uncovering patterns in historical data, the project aims to produce **actionable insights and reliable predictions** to support informed decision-making in the renewable energy sector.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes:

* **Weather conditions** across various Spanish cities from **2015 to 2017**
* **Three-hourly load shortfalls** during the same period (the gap between fossil fuel and renewable energy generation)
* **47 features** including time-based and city-specific weather variables
* **1 target variable** representing the load shortfall

---

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Data explored, patterns identified
* **Preprocessing:** Data cleaned, relevant features engineered or enhanced
* **Modeling:** Various machine learning models trained and optimized
* **Validation:** Best model selected based on performance and used to generate a **Kaggle-style submission**
